# PTDNet

This is a Tensorflow implementation of paper: <b>Learning to Drop: Robust Graph Neural Network via Topological Denoising</b>

https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07057

<i>WSDM'21</i>


Unofficial Implementation <b> Robust Graph Representation Learning via Neural Sparsification</b>

<i> ICML 20</i>


Since the previous version is not easy to use, I've updated the code from Tensorflow 1.0 to Tensorflow 2.0.
Currently, I only provide sample implementation for reference. 
Hyper-parameters for different datasets need tune.

## Requirements
  * Python 3.8.6
  * tensorflow 2.3.1
  * networkx
